# 🏦 Loan Approval & Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **loan approval status** using supervised machine learning techniques. Financial institutions receive numerous loan applications daily, and manual evaluation is time-consuming and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that automatically determines whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on applicant information.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Loan approval decisions depend on multiple factors such as income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount.  
The challenge is to accurately classify loan applications using historical data while minimizing risk and bias.

This project solves the problem using **supervised classification algorithms**.
